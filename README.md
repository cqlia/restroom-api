# Bathroom App API

Backend API for a class project, which utilized an app to manage a list of restrooms.

Given that this code was not submitted, there shouldn't be any issues with making it public.
What _was_ submitted was the app it was attached to.
The implementation of this frontend is up to the reader.

An OpenAPI spec is available [here](docs/api.yaml).

## Usage

> [!WARNING]
