# Bathroom App API

Backend API for a class project, which utilized an app to manage a list of restrooms.

Given that this code was not submitted, there shouldn't be any issues with making it public.
What _was_ submitted was the app it was attached to.
The implementation of this frontend is up to the reader.

An OpenAPI spec is available [here](docs/api.yaml).

## Usage

> [!WARNING]
> There is no moderation functionality built into the API.
> Please do not run this as a public application!!

I don't know.

Using this backend for a school project is **not** advised if you happen to have the same professor as me.

This code is unmaintained and should be used as a reference at best.
Given that this appears to be one of the very few projects available using the latest versions of the ZIO stack (a very painful realization), it could be helpful.
